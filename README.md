## canal 是什么
https://github.com/alibaba/canal
> 阿里巴巴mysql数据库binlog的增量订阅&消费组件

## flume-canal-source 做了什么
flume-canal-source 是对flume的source扩展。从canal获取数据到flume channel。
进而可以实现binlog数据到kafka/hdfs/hive/elasticsearch等等。

## 如何使用

下面是flume - source 配置
```properties
agent.sources = canalSource

agent.sources.canalSource.type = com.weiboyi.etl.flume.source.canal.CanalSource


# zookeeper servers
agent.sources.canalSource.zkServers = zookeeperhost:2181

# canal destination
agent.sources.canalSource.destination = destinatino

# agent.sources.canalSource.username = user
# agent.sources.canalSource.password = passwd

# binlog batch size, default is 1024
agent.sources.canalSource.batchSize = 1024

# 是否需要修改前的数据
agent.sources.canalSource.oldDataRequired = true
